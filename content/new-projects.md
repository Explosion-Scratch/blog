Hello guys! I just realized that wow! I had a blog and it had 6 stars, and I hadn't posted in a while, so here we are. Anyways, to the 2 of you reading (thanks retron) sorry I hadn't posted for a while.

I've also been working on some pretty epic new projects so I'll list some of those below:

## Numbero uno

Chrome extensions!! (multiple projects actually), anyways, I've been working on some cool chrome extensions lately! I also finally got a chrome webstore account so I can publish them, here are the published ones:

**Clean green theme**:
Just a nice green theme that I made, it has some particles in the background =)

## Number 2 (‚úåÔ∏è): Tab searcher

This is (yes) another chrome extension, but this one took a REALLY long time and a lot of effort to make. As of writing it hasn't been published into the chrome webstore yet, but hopefully it'll be reviewed soon! Anyways, it searches tabs, history, downloads, and gets quick answers from google! It's super useful and it's one of the few chrome extensions of mine that I actually use (well, I have a TON of extensions I made but most of them are for really small stuff and I never share). Anyways, here are some images of that:

## Number 4 (üññ): GitHub Gists

I've also made some gists on GitHub gist with stuff like parsing the google quick answer HTML, generating a canvas matrix effect, socket.io + express starter, password generator based on domain and master password, morse code, meta search, delete all of watch later, generate 2fa auth tokens, compress a string using native browser APIs, generate a favicon with a number on it (like Gmail), and many more things like that!
