Hi guys! I usually don't write articles about non code-related things but I though I'd branch out a bit! YouTube has released an experimental feature they're calling "Heatseeker".

Here's what it looks like by the way:

I think there are a few pros and cons to this new feature:

**Pros**:

- It would allow users to find the useful part of a video with ease
- It might be interesting to try out
- It might save users' time

**Cons:**

- It could significantly decrease watch time for creators, because instead of watching the video, people would just skip to a certain part
- It might lead to a sort of infinite loop, e.g. if someone seeks to a particular spot for no reason, it's possible that other people would see that spike and fuel it by seeking to that same spot and watching it. This would mean that statistics are not nessecarily relevant
- YouTube is tracking one more thing about you

Another thing that I thought of, is why would YouTube want to add this feature? Their whole business model is to get you to stay on their platform as long as possible and therefore watch as many ads as possible, so if you can just skip to specific parts of the video it would be detrimental to them, right?

Anyways, I just spent a few minutes writing this, so not a long post,

Have a good day!
